Heres the Forgotpassword flow

1.In android client side you hit the forgot password button,  and it asks you to enter in your email

2.You send out your email and spring boot gets the email and sends out the password reset link

3.Once you've seen the password reset link in your email you click it and a thymeleaf page opens up and you
enter your newPassword and confirmpassword

4.Once you hit resetpassword, that new password gets stored in the database and android can now use that new passwword

5.after the user has reset their password through the web interface, 
they would need to manually enter this new password in the Android app's login screen.
