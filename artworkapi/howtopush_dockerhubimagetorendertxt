I had soo many issues, trying to host this application and i was doing so many things wrong.

One of the MAIN issue i had was, i was doing the self sighed certificate and the https logic
note to self you do NOT need that because render already handles https request, i had to
delete some things in the applications.properties to revert it back to http, and also delete the .p12 file aka the signed certificate
and then it worked.

But Heres how i Hosted my pushed docker image from docker hub to render!.


Step 1.Make sure you have the image up and loaded

Step 2. In react render go to dashboard

Step 3.Click on New +, then Web service

Step 4.Select Deploy an existing image from a registry

Step 5.in the Image URL, you want to paste the full url from the Dockerhub for example:

You want to do this:

mlallencodes499/artworkdockerimage:v1

Not this:

mlallencodes499/artworkdockerimage

Step 6.Make sure you select the free tier and you should be good to go

Step 7.After its done building wait 30 seconds or so and then check the url, make sure it runs in postman and through the browser
then its all done!.
